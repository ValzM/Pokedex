# Pokedex

I realized this project to learn how to use REST APIs.

## Description

A pokedex is a technological object present in the Pokémon universe. 
It is an encyclopedia that lists all the pokémon encountered by its owner.
With this pokédex you can :

  - display all the pokémons
  - display the pokémons according to their types

## What I learned 
  
  - Javascript Promise
  - Fetch
  - API request
  - Abort a request
